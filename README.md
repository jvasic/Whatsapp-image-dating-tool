# Whatsapp image dater
A python script to add dates from the name to the metadata of your Whatsapp images. Made from personal need, with the help of Stackoverflow.

HOW IT WORKS:
Whatsapp saves image dates in the file name and not in the metadata. This script adds the image date from its name to its metadata.

HOW TO USE:
1. Put all Whatsaspp images you want to add dates to to a folder
2. Copy the folder path to the marked place in the script

DISCLAIMER: In the current version, all the images are saved with the same time (8 pm), as Whatsapp doesn't keep the exact time the image was created in its name.
